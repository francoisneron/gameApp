#GameApp

16/12/2015 : Fix needed
- Make the adult game stable and working (production ready) is a priority
	-Add validation for number of question in database (modal dialog), so that we run the game without bug.
	-Game should end on the 10th question and the last question. It should congratulate the user on completion.
	-Explanation/reason should be modal dialog.
	-This is really important!!!


- Make the kid game stable and working (production ready) is a priority
	-Add validation for number of question in database (modal dialog), so that we run the game without bug.
